                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the Coding language to make websites and webpages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it's used in order to make websites and webpages look pretty with many colors and even sometimes animations. Bootstrap
                    is another component of HTML and CSS that uses it's own CSS library of classes to help with organization of the webpage and not make it look like a huge mess.
